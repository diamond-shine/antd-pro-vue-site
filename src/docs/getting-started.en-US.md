# Getting Started

Ant Design Pro is a production-ready solution for admin interfaces. Built on the design principles developed by [Ant Design](http://ant.design/), this project introduces higher level components; we have developed templates, components, and a corresponding design kit to improve the user and development experience for admin interfaces.


Your help is welcomed and much appreciated. With your feedback we can make incremental progress towards elegant and well designed components. Please open a issue or submit a pull request!

With those objectives in mind, we have built the following templates and a scaffold based on React.js, which should help you prototyping production-ready admin interfaces.
